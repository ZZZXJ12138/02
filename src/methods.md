## 实验方法

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">精英级助理裁判员在全场比赛中大约会进行 1053 次活动变化，其中大部分是随比赛发展（如越位线的变化）做出的反应<sup>20</sup>。因此，助理裁判员必须针对视觉信号（如最后第二名防守队员的位置）做出反应，采取合理的变向动作；这通常要求裁判员尽全力完成连续的侧向往返跑<sup>20,21,25</sup>。研究表明，助理裁判员离越位线越近，就能拥有更好的视野，以做出正确的判罚，避免产生错误的旗语<sup>13,14</sup>。因此，变向能力应当被视为合理跑位的前提，并根据助理裁判员的实际比赛需求进行评估和训练<sup>13,14,26</sup>。变向能力也应当被视为灵活性的功能前提，针对进行中的动作采取变向反应<sup>26</sup>。在这方面，10-8-8-10 测试是首个被系统性提出的用于评估精英级助理裁判员变向能力的简易场地测试。由于灵活性和变向能力尚未建立黄金标准，因此在这一阶段，可以由专家来判断测试的比赛相关性，并通过定性比赛分析来评估 10-8-8-10 测试的信度<sup>19</sup>。</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">10-8-8-10 测试通过研究意大利精英级助理裁判员在正式比赛中的运动模式而定性开发。在开发过程中，研究人员参考了科学报告的精英级助理裁判员平均冲刺距离与冲刺时间，并根据测试可行性进行了调整，以保证数据收集的一致性<sup>20,21,25</sup>。具体来看，考虑到助理裁判员在前期试点研究中的平均跑动时间以及时间-动作分析所得出的常规单次冲刺时间（2 秒），测试中的正向跑动距离被设定为 10 米<sup>20</sup>。而测试中的侧向往返跑则是由助理裁判员在比赛中最常用的动作演变而来，旨在与倒数第二名防守球员的位置保持一致。整个 10-8-8-10 测试采用往返跑的形式，起终点设置在同一位置，是为了贴近实际比赛需求，同时便于计时，保证测试的可行性。</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">在 10-8-8-10 测试中，助理裁判员首先向前冲刺 10 米，然后以 10 米终点线为参照，迅速进行一次 8 米的侧向往返跑，最后快速跑回起点，即算完成测试 （总距离 10 + 8 + 8 + 10 米 = 36 米）。在测试过程中，裁判员每次变向都必须保证前脚接触到参考线（包括 10 米和 8 米参考线）。只有遵循上述程序的测试跑才会被纳入研究分析。在开始 10-8-8-10 测试之前，所有参与者都会提前熟悉测试规则，并进行测试练习。</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">研究人员从两支裁判员队伍（一级&二级联赛 n = 90；三级联赛 n = 200）中各随机抽取 50 名助理裁判员进行对比分析，检验测试的建构效度。建构效度被用于评估一项测试在区分不同竞技水平的运动员方面的敏感度<sup>17,24</sup>。但对于分析过程中可能出现的准则效度差异，如果不能对可能的干扰变量进行精确控制，就很难解释该差异出现的原因<sup>28</sup>。为了控制训练对该助理裁判员群体测试可能产生的影响，研究人员有意将本实验设置在赛季准备阶段之后进行。这么做是为了避免不同级别的训练对裁判员体能表现（即 10-8-8-10 测试结果）产生差异影响。在此准备阶段，所有相关的助理裁判员都会共同参与一个训练项目，旨在提高决定执法表现的体能因素<sup>20,25</sup>。在意大利足球裁判协会（AIA）指定的专业助理裁判员体能训练讲师的帮助下，确保了参与者遵循训练日程。训练负荷以不同体能类别的训练时间为指标，包括耐力、冲刺与灵活性、反复冲刺能力以及柔韧性<sup>10,11</sup>。</p>

Before the commencement of the procedures used in this study, face validity was gained by a questionnaire in which experts (i.e., current and former top-class AR, n = 20) rated the 10-8-8-10 using a 1–5 scale for specificity (i.e., test relevance for AR performance: 1 = trivial, 2 = small, 3 = medium, 4 = large, and 5 = very large). The overall ratings (n = 20) for the 10-8-8-10 were "large" to "very large" (n = 4 and 16 of 20, respectively).

## 实验对象

Participants were 100 ARs belonging to the AIA who were appointed for officiating in the 2009–2010 Serie A-B (n = 50, AR<sub>A-B</sub>, age 37 ± 2.9 years, height 1.78 ± 6.9 cm, body mass 74 ± 6.9 kg) and Lega Pro (n = 50, AR<sub>LP</sub>, age 34 ± 2.0 years, height 1.77 ± 4.9 cm, body mass 75 ± 4.9 kg) Italian professional championships. The ARs had at least 2 years (range 2–8 years) of experience at their respective competitive level (i.e., Serie A-B and Lega Pro, respectively) and performed at least 3 training sessions a week for the development of specific fitness. All ARs were tested during the training camp held at the end of the precompetitive season (i.e., July–August). To avoid undue stress on the AR in the days preceding the implementation of the 10-8-8-10 test, training loads were intentionally reduced, and familiarization sessions were considered. The ARs were advised to maintain a regular diet during the day before testing (i.e., 60, 25, and 15% of carbohydrates, fat, and protein, respectively) and to refrain from smoking and caffeinated drinks during the 2 hours preceding testing. To avoid hypohydration, ARs were allowed to drink fluids "ad libitum". Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants after familiarization and explanation of the benefit and risks involved in the procedures of this study. All participants were informed that they were free to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. The Institutional Research Board (Settore Tecnico AIA, Modulo per la preparazione Atletica) provided clearance for the procedures before the commencement of this study. All procedures were carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of the World Medical Association as regards the conduct of clinical research.

## 实验流程

All the test procedures were performed at the same hours of the day (i.e., 9–11 AM) in the absence of wind and in similar environmental conditions (i.e., 23–26°C, 50–60% humidity). The 10-8-8-10 test was performed at the end of a standard warm-up consisting each time of 15 minutes of slow jogging (i.e., 2–3 of Börg’s CR 10 scale) followed by static stretching (5 minutes) and agility and sprint practice (8 minutes) (1,7). The AR performed 3 trials of the 10-8-8-10 test interspersed by 2 minutes of passive recovery in between. All tests were performed on the same synthetic turf usually used for fitnesstraining sessions. The 10-8-8-10 test performance was assumed as total time and assessed using a telemetric photocells system (Polifemo Kit Racetime2, Microgate, Bolzano, Italy). To avoid undue switch-on of the timing system, ARs had to position the front foot immediately before a line set 0.50 m from the photocell beam. The photocell beam was positioned at 0.5-m height and 1.5 m apart. All the ARs performed the 10-8-8-10 test with a self-administered start, and maximum performance was induced through strong verbal encouragements by the test leader (i.e., first author) during all the test duration.

The 10-8-8-10 test reliability was established by having ARs (n = 64) performing the test under the above declared conditions on 3 different occasions separated by a recovery (a low training load session) day. Best and average 10-8-8-10 performances were used for calculation.

## 统计分析

The results are expressed as mean ± *SD* and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Normality assumption was verified using the Shapiro–Wilk *W*-test. Student’s *t*-tests (unpaired design) were used to determine any significant difference between the 2 competitive levels (i.e., AR<sub>A-B</sub> and AR<sub>LP</sub>). Homogeneity of variance was tested with the Bartlett test. The effect size (ES) was calculated to assess meaningfulness of differences (8). Effect sizes of >0.8, between 0.8 and 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.2, and <0.2 were considered as large, moderate, small, and trivial, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess relative reliability of the 10-8-8-10 test. Absolute reliability was assessed calculating the typical error of measurement (TEM) according to Hopkins (15). Sensitivity of the 10-8-8-10 test was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) statistics. To allow ROC calculations, ARs were dichotomized according to their competitive level (i.e., AR<sub>AB</sub> and AR<sub>LP</sub>). Normative data were reported as interquartile range (31). The smallest
worthwhile change was assumed as 0.2I according to Hopkins at al. (16). Significance was set at 5% (p &leq; 0.05).
