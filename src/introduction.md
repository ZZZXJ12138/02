# 引言

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">任何一场足球比赛都会由一名场地裁判员（FR）所管控，场地裁判员在受指派的比赛中全权执行竞赛规则<sup>12</sup>。在比赛过程中，场地裁判员与两名助理裁判员（ARs）合作，控制和规范球员和教练的行为，而助理裁判员的主要职责是依据越位线检查球员位置，这在任何情况下都是裁判的首要任务<sup>12</sup>。场地裁判员可以在足球场内自由移动，但助理裁判员只可以沿着半场的边线移动，并在此过程中监管比赛。因此，助理裁判员跑动时需要面向球场。在判断是否越位时，裁判员最好采用侧向移动，让自己获得更好的视野。和场地裁判员一样，助理裁判员也必须跟上比赛节奏<sup>9</sup>。与场地裁判员相比，助理裁判员所面临的生理和体能要求较低<sup>13,20,21,25</sup>，但也曾有顶级助理裁判员在比赛中感到疲劳，并在赛后出现反复冲刺能力下降的情况<sup>20</sup>。</p>

During the game (i.e., ~90 minutes), the AR covers approximately 6–8 km of which 1.2 with sideways running (i.e., 16%) (20). In top-class ARs, 110 high-intensity running activities were reported with a mean duration of 2 seconds (20). Interestingly moving along the 50-m portion of the side line of competence, a top-level AR changes activity every 5 seconds totaling 1,053 activities (20). Given the highfrequency rate and variety in activity changes experienced by an elite-level AR during the game, the ability to perform sudden changes of direction, shifting from forward sprinting to sideways movement, assume face validity.

The possession of a well-developed physical fitness is considered as a necessary prerequisite for optimal positioning and work-rate output in AR (20). Indeed, distance from the offside line as determined by the second last defender position has been related to the sprint ability of the AR (20). Furthermore, association between individual aerobic fitness and the ability to repeat sprint with distance covered at high intensity during the game was reported (20).

The refereeing international governing body (UEFA, European Union of Association Football, and FIFA [International Union of Association Football]) acknowledged the need for physical fitness assessment of the elite level AR. This was accomplished requiring a number of field tests aiming to evaluate AR repeated sprint ability (6 x 40-m sprints) and intermittent high-intensity endurance (30–40") before top competitions (33). These tests although significantly stressing the physiological characteristics of the AR possess low face validity as per distance considered and exercise mode used (33). Indeed, they consider only line running, neglecting sideways running considered as a specific of AR performance (20). Furthermore, they do not evaluate the ability to perform sudden changes of direction, repeated changes, and also the specific distances experienced by AR during the most demanding phases of the game (20). Unfortunately, to the best of this study authors’ knowledge, no study has been published in scientific journals that proposed and examined the validity (i.e., face and construct validity) and reliability of a test for change of direction ability (CODA) for ARs.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the applicability of a new field test (i.e., 10-8-8-10) aiming to assess CODA of elite level AR involving forward and sideways shuttle running. In the pursuit of this aim, construct validity and reliability of the 10-8-8-10 test were assessed. Before the experimental procedures, face validity was established using time–motion analysis and expert judgment procedures.
