The CODA is considered as an important prerequisite to promote specific agility in ARs (13,14,20,25). In this regard, the 10-8-8-10 possessing logical validity and good reliability may be successfully used to track changes in CODA performance in trained ARs at the beginning of the competitive season. Furthermore, the 10-8-8-10 test considering sideways shuttle running may be used to train AR in developing the physical prerequisite useful to track offside situation during the match.

Because of short-term variation in 10-8-8-10 performance (~0.18 seconds), difference in performance &geq;0.18 seconds can be considered as meaningful. Performance changes &geq;0.07 seconds and <0.18 seconds should be considered with caution. The same consideration should be used when considering interindividual differences for ranking difference. Given the population addressed in this study, the 10-8-8-10 test values reported here may be considered as reference normative values for highly competitive-level ARs before the beginning of the competitive season (22). For AR populations similar to those in this study, the 10-8-8-10 test scores &leq;9.67 seconds should be considered as of interest. This information may be considered to be of importance for national and international soccer referees governing bodies aiming to implement and assess agility training programs for elite ARs.
